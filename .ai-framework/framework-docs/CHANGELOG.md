### 🙏 Origin Story
Born from real-world collaboration between Local Claude Code and Online Claude during the SimpleCP project. What began as a simple "file ready" workflow evolved into Avery's vision of universal AI collaboration.

**Avery's Key Insight**: *"If AIs can communicate through repository files, then we've created something universal - a framework that could work in any repository, with any AIs, for any project."*

This release represents the culmination of that insight, packaged for the entire developer community.
